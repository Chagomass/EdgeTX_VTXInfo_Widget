# EdgeTX_VTXInfo_Widget
Little homemade LUA Widget, designed on EdgeTX 2.6, to display VTX Informations on Main Screens


# Installation

Copy the /VTXInfo folder into the /WIDGETS/ folder of your SD Card

There is my ETX Backup.etx to show how I've set up my Radiomaster TX16S to control GV1 and GV2 to be, respectively, my VTX Power and VTX Channel.
I've mapped the VTX Channel in Betaflight to be switching from channels [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8]

# Suggestions

I'm open to any suggestions of improvements !
